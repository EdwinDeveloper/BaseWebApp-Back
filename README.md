Getting Started with a Base Web Application

This README provides an introduction to a base web application that encompasses fundamental features and security implementations.

Base Web Application Features:

Two Factor Authentication Element:
Enhance the security of the application by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA). This ensures an additional layer of protection for user accounts.

Expiration of the Current User Password:
Enforce a password expiration policy, prompting users to change their passwords periodically for improved security.

Recovery Password Process:
Implement a robust recovery password process for users who forget their passwords or are locked out of their accounts. This process involves identity verification through security questions or email confirmation.

Warning Password Expiration:
Proactively notify users when their passwords are approaching expiration, encouraging timely updates to maintain account security.

Basic Encryption Process:
Incorporate a basic encryption process to safeguard sensitive information, such as user credentials and other confidential data, ensuring secure storage.

Message Management Module:

This module focuses on managing messages sent by end users and maintaining a comprehensive history of user interactions.

Key Features:
Message History:
Manage and store the history of user movements, including essential details such as request, template, date, origin, and destination of the final message.
Template Personalization:
Customize message templates based on the message type configuration. This flexibility caters to the diverse requirements of service providers, including platforms like Facebook, Gmail, Outlook, and more.
Security Implementation:

To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data, the application incorporates robust security measures.

Encryption of Database:
Secure data in the database through encryption, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Spring Security:
Leverage the Spring Security framework for comprehensive security features and controls.
JWT Expiration:
Implement JSON Web Token (JWT) expiration to manage access and enhance security.
Two Factor Authentication (TFA) Implementation:
Strengthen user authentication with Two Factor Authentication, adding an extra layer of security.
Open Source Project:

As an open-source project, the goal is to share the necessary elements for this module to fulfill its basic function of administering the automation of sending messages. The module aims to address the diverse requirements of service providers while ensuring it is not misused as a spam tool. By sharing these elements, the project can contribute to solving problems for companies or students.

Feel free to explore the provided features and security implementations, and don't hesitate to contribute to the open-source project!
